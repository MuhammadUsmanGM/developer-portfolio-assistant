Excited to share a glimpse into my journey as an aspiring AI agent developer! I'm actively building UV projects and diving deep into Python and C++ to explore the world of high-performance backend technologies.

I'm passionate about open-source contributions and constantly learning. Check out my GitHub ([https://github.com/MuhammadUsmanGM](https://github.com/MuhammadUsmanGM)) to see my latest projects and contributions. With 20 repositories and growing, I'm always eager to learn and collaborate.

I'd love to connect with fellow developers and enthusiasts! What are you working on? Let's discuss the future of AI agents and high-performance computing.
